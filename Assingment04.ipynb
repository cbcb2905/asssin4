        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects, defining the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. Objects are the entities created using the class blueprint, holding specific data and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: The concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also includes restricting access to some of the object's components to ensure controlled modification, typically using access specifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: A mechanism by which one class (child or subclass) can inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass). This allows code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types). It allows one function or method to work in different ways based on the object it is acting upon, commonly achieved through method overriding or overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts are fundamental in designing robust, reusable, and maintainable code in OOP systems."
